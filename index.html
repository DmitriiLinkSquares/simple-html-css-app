      The <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
      <strong>L</strong>anguage or HTML is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
      such as JavaScript.
    </p>
    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>
      In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
      prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
      documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
      hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and
      server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
      engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but
      the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4]
      from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"
      and put an encyclopedia first.

    <h3>Elements</h3>
    <p>
      Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end,
      including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested)
      elements, as children of the parent element.

    <h3>Frameset versus transitional</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to the above transitional differences, the frameset
      specifications (whether XHTML 1.0 or HTML 4.01) specify a different
      content model, with frameset replacing body, that contains either frame
      elements, or optionally noframes with a body.
